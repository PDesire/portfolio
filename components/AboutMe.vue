    <p>Hey, welcome to my page!</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I am Tristan, a 20 y.o. software developer, trying to become a
      revolutionary with the power of technology.

    <p>
      I like to code (who guessed it :D), but also I'm interested in sociology,
      politics, anime, japanese culture and traveling to as many places as
      possible.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In my spare time, I love to go among people, but I am also sometimes at
      home to relax or visualize project ideas.

    <p>
      As an 11 year old child I was already interested in IT and computers. I
      wanted to know how they work.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      From that time on I started to build my first websites with HTML, which
      became boring in the long run.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      After that I started to work with Java. Java was the gateway to
      programming for me as a child and so I started to learn more and more.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Sometime I also started with the Android development and moved more and
      more into the frontend and from there into the backend.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      It is my goal in the long run not to become an idiot who only knows one
      thing. I want to know more, and that's why I'm continuously educating
      myself further.
